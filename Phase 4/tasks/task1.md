Your Mission:

In your api_project, install ruff.
Create a Python file and deliberately write some messy code: use inconsistent indentation, import a library but don't use it, and create a variable but never use it.
Run ruff format . to fix the styling.
Run ruff check . to find the unused import and variable errors.
