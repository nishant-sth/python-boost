# Your Mission:

In your api_project, create a file validators.py.
Copy your validate_password function from the Phase 1 mission into this file.
Install pytest.
Create a test_validators.py file.
Inside the test file, write at least four separate test functions:
test_valid_password that asserts True for a good password.
test_password_too_short that asserts False for a short password.
test_password_missing_uppercase that asserts False.
test_password_missing_number that asserts False.
Run pytest and see all your tests pass.
