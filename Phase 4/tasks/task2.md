Your Mission:

Activate the virtual environment inside your api_project.
Use pip to install the requests and Faker libraries.
Generate a requirements.txt file that contains these packages and their dependencies.
Open the file and look at the contents.
(Bonus) Create a second virtual environment, activate it, and use your new requirements.txt file to install the exact same packages.
