## Tasks
    Create a script product.py.
    Inside, create variables for a product: name (str), price (float), quantity_in_stock (int), and is_on_sale (bool).
    Assign realistic values to them.
    Write a print statement that displays all the product's information in a readable sentence.
    Calculate the total value of the inventory for that product (price * quantity_in_stock) and print it.
