## Your Mission:

.. Create a script student_grades.py.
.. Create a list of student names.
.. Create a dict where keys are student names (from your list) and values are their corresponding grades (e.g., 88, 92, 75).
.. Write code to calculate the average grade of all students.
.. Pick one student. Use an f-string to print their name and grade.
.. Create a set of all the subjects the students are taking (e.g., "Math", "Science"). Add a subject that's already there to prove that sets only store unique values.
