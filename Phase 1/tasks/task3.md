## Your Mission:

.. The Number Guessing Game: Write a script that generates a random number between 1 and 100.
.. Use a while loop to repeatedly ask the user to guess the number.
.. Inside the loop, use if/elif/else to tell the user if their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
.. If they guess correctly, print a success message and break the loop.
.. Bonus: Keep track of the number of guesses and print it at the end.
