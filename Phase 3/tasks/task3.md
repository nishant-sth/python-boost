# Your Mission:

Write a decorator called @debug_info.
This decorator should print the name of the function being called, the arguments it was called with (args and kwargs), and the value it returns.
Create a simple function add(a, b) that returns their sum.
Apply your @debug_info decorator to the add function and call it (e.g., add(5, 10)) to see your debug output.
