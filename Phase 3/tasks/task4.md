# Your Mission:

Write a generator function fibonacci(limit) that yields Fibonacci numbers up to a given limit. (The sequence starts 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...).
Write a script that calls this generator and prints each Fibonacci number it produces.
Create a "lazy" version of your list comprehension from the previous mission. Given prices = [10.99, 25.50, 9.75, 50.00, 105.25], create a generator expression that yields each price increased by 20%. Loop through the generator and print each new price.
