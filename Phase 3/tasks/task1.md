# Your Mission:

You are given a list of strings: words = ["hello", "world", "python", "is", "fun"].
Use a list comprehension to create a new list called upper_words that contains all the words from the original list, but in uppercase.
You have a list of product prices: prices = [10.99, 25.50, 9.75, 50.00, 105.25]. Use a list comprehension to create a new list called prices_with_tax where each price is increased by 20%.
Use a dictionary comprehension and the words list to create a dictionary where the keys are the words and the values are the lengths of the words.
